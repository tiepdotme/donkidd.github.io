## Starting Small but remember it will go bigger

I'm just starting to learn how to write and run some tests so lets just run them on my computer.  I don't need a big hub and several nodes to run hundreds of tests at a time lets just begin running one test at a time.  So I want to start my automated testing adventure by verifying that a form launches correctly.

## Writing automated tests with PHP

Miami is a [PHP](php.net) shop, everything we write, is in PHP, so I want to find a solution to do these tests that all of the developers can use.  I also wanted to use something so that down the road when Product Owners started looking at "testing criteria" that they could understand.  So first thing we discovered was [Cucumber](cucumber.io), I love the fact that everything in Cucumber is written in regular English.

Feature: Eating too many cucumbers may not be good for you

  Eating too much of anything may not be good for you.

  Scenario: Eating a few is no problem
    Given Alice is hungry
    When she eats 3 cucumbers
    Then she will be full
```

In order to use Cucumber with PHP we've started looking at [Behat](behat.org).  Behat is considered an official Cucumber implementation in PHP so this is the way we are going to go to look at using PHP & Cucumber.

## Behat

So now that we decided to use Behat so that anyone could write scenarios in English how would those scenarios interact with a browser.  While doing the research it looks like [Mink](mink.behat.org) appears to be the way to go to interact with a browser.

Mink seems like a great option to interact with Selenium from a PHP application using Behat.
