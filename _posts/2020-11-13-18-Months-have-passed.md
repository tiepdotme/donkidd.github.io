# Where has the time gone #

So the second half of 2019 and most of 2020 have flown by.  I haven't written a thing on this site.  I had been using this site as a place to share thoughts and ideas about conferences and the learning process I have been going through.  I wanted to let the few people who might check out this site that I am still working along with the quality effort at Miami and we are slowly making progress. 

## Changes can be good but hard ##

We have had gone through many changes at Miami within the organization and so I have been rethinking my role as a Quality Assurance Analyst.  I want to gather my thoughts a bit more and hope to share some of how I see my role and our role as Quality people.

## Keep on pushing through it ##

While we may feel like we are trying to walk through wet sand, I want to encourage everyone that we are making changes and even it doesn't seem like it, every little step, helps us move our change a little farther.
