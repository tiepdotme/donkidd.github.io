# Training Time

So here I am, Orlando, FL.  The Sunshine state, and I get to spend my whole time here training rooms.

I arrived in Orlando, last night to spend the next 6 days learning about testing and what my job means.  I get to learn from others, see what they are doing and just get a better overall understanding of how to bring a department of developers up to the place where they can test.

I will share my next 5 days of training at [StarEast](https://stareast.techwell.com/)
 from sunny Orlando.

## Day 1 & 2

### Agile Tester Certification
This sounds like what I need to see how testing will fit in with Miami, as we start down this road of QA and being more Agile.

>* Discover how testing is implemented in different agile environments
* Learn about user stories and how to test them
* Explore key agile testing practices—ATDD, BDD, TDD, and ET
* Examine technical and team skills you need for success
* Recognize the main agile testing challenges and how to address them

## Day 3

### Testing Under Pressure: A Case for Session-Based Test Management
What is Session-Based test management?  Is this something I can use at Miami.

>The nature of exploration, coupled with the ability of testers to rapidly apply their skills and experience, make exploratory testing a widely-used test approach—especially when time is short. Unfortunately, exploratory testing is often dismissed by project managers who assume that it is not reproducible, measurable, or accountable.

## Day 3

### How Testers Master Git and GitHub
We are just switching over to GIT, are their tips and tricks that will help us?  How can I integrate testing into the git process?

>Today’s testers need to learn about and use GitHub, too. Join Wilson Mar as he examines the major GitHub repositories testers should know about. In this hands-on tutorial, you’ll learn why and how GitHub is being used for most open source projects and many private projects.
