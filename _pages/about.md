I'm using this site as a way to document the steps we have taken to build our QA team here at [Miami](http://www.miamioh.edu). I will also include the sites I'm using to gather information.

Maybe this site can hopefully be used a resource for others.  Hopefully your can learn from our mistakes or maybe I will just be able to provide insite into my crazy world.
