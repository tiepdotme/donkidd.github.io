## Tutorial Day 1

I started my week of CAST 2018 with a Tutorial with Anne-Marie Charrett as she taught us about being a coach and what it looks like to coach those around us.  Specifically she was teaching about coaching testers but it was more than just that.  We spent the day talking about coaching, which is a lot like teaching but really a one-on-one experince.  We did talk a little about coaching in a group setting, but most of it was doing individual coaching.

When Anne-Marie started she did coaching over email and skype and slack so we tried coaching in that manner it was a little strange but that might just be because we were in the room with each other.

The next 2 or 3 practice coaching sessions we did were in person, which felt a lot more like what I would expect to be doing at Miami.  That went a bit better than the Slack one and it was on a topic of our choice so it felt less forced and more productive.

I also had some good conversations with attendees and made some good connections.  I would highly recommend Anne-Marie Charrett and her teaching about coaching.
